    "text": "Bio\nNina Attias is a Brazilian conservation biologist with over 15 years of experience in ecological studies. She has a PhD in Ecology and Conservation from Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul and a Master’s degree in Ecology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Her research is in the broad area of spatial ecology applied to conservation, where she integrates behavioral ecology, spatial ecology and conservation biology to inform conservation decision making and outreach programs in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil. As an instructor and a field biologist, her postdoctoral research focuses on indentifying methods, tools, infrastructure and resources needed to teach field based courses remotely.

The amount of variability within a system is thought to influence most aspects of plant-herbivore biology, from ecological stability to plant defense evolution. Our understanding of what influences variability, however, is limited by sparse data. We collected standardized surveys of herbivory for 503 plant species at 790 sites across 116° of latitude. With these data, we show that within-population variability in herbivory increases with latitude, decreases with plant size, and is phylogenetically structured. Differences in the magnitude of variability are thus central to how plant-herbivore biology varies across macroscale gradients. We argue that increased focus on interaction variability will advance understanding of patterns of life on Earth. Herbivory is a major selection pressure on plants, which have evolved many different physical and chemical adaptations to prevent animals from eating their tissues. However, herbivory pressure can be highly variable, even between plants in the same population. The Herbivory Variability Network consortium used standardized surveys to compare herbivory variability within populations at 790 sites across five continents. They found that the weak increase in mean herbivory at lower latitudes was accompanied by lower variation between individuals. Smaller plant species had higher herbivory variability, which also showed a phylogenetic signal. These findings highlight how variation in species interactions can influence eco-evolutionary outcomes. —Bianca Lopez Smaller plants at lower latitudes show higher variation in herbivory pressure among individuals.} }"

They are also the home to millions of people, the source of products central to our lives, shape global climate, and are being cleared at unprecedented rates. Students in this class will investigate the same fundamental questions asked by scientists that study rain forests: Why are we fascinated by rain forests? How have stereotypes about them permeated everything from pop culture to international relations? What gave rise to their remarkable biodiversity? What are the drivers and consequences of deforestation? Is rain forest conservation compatible with socioeconomic development?\nStudents will explore these questions by reading and discussing a research studies, gathering and analyzing multidisciplinary data, interviewing people engaged in forest-related activities, and by reflecting on the consequences for rain forests of our choices as consumers, scholars, and community members. The course is taught in a non-traditional format: in-class sessions will be devoted to activities ranging from conversations with journalists, scientists, and conservation practitioners based in tropical countries to gathering and analyzing data on deforestation to reading and discussing scientific studies. There might be a field trip to a museum or supermarket. There might even be an occasional lecture. Instead of readings from a textbook, most weeks we will read a scientific study or some texts intended for a general audience (e.g., newspaper articles, chapters from memoir). The assignments are designed to maximize personal reflection and creativity…and yes, you can actually get credit for watching movies like Predator, Rio, and Apocalypse Now.\n{{&lt; cta \"Link to Course Website\" \"https://ids2935.netlify.app/\" &gt;}}"

However, those interested in working with our group should:\n\nBe interested in using experiments, modeling, or other quantitative methods to test novel hypotheses in plant population ecology or plant-animal interactions.\n\nBe interested in the application of their results to the conservation of biological resources. Your thesis need not be entirely applied, but I hope at least part of it will be.\n\nBe eager to work in a stimulating and collegial academic environment. I expect my graduate students to participate in activities such as the departmental seminar series, lab meetings, and reading groups. I also encourage them to develop collaborations and side projects with other faculty and students with whom they share mutual research interests.\n\nActively pursue fellowships and financial support for their work. This is not only good practice for the future, but earning grants and fellowships while in graduate school makes you a much stronger candidate for jobs after you’ve graduated.\nGet along well with others and have a positive outlook. Grad school will be challenging, and sometimes frustrating, but it should also be fun and personally rewarding."
