  funding.text = {The ideas for this paper were first conceived at a workshop on experimental and theoretical approaches to habitat fragmentation at Station d'Ecologie Theorique et Experimentale in Moulis, France. We thank organizers of the workshop and of this Fragmentation Special Issue, the participants who responded to the survey, and Doug Levey and the Davies and Melbourne lab members at the Univ. of Colorado at Boulder for feedback. JR was supported by an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology (NSF-PRFB, award 1309192).},
