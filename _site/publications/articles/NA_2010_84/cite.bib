  funding.text = {We would like to thank many members of the Ichauway plant lab for assistance in the Weld. These people include M. Kaeser, M. Creech, K. Stuble, S. Wiggers, K. Coffey, and many others. Assistance with statistical analyses was provided by M. Brennan with the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Science Statistics Department. W. Cropper and M. Creech provided helpful comments on an early version of this manuscript. The suggestions of R. Mitchell, H. Stevens, and an anonymous reviewer significantly improved the final version and pointed out some relevant studies that had been overlooked. The University of Florida's Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation and the J. W. Jones Ecological Research Center provided logistical support throughout the project. Funding was provided by the J. W. Jones Ecological Research Center, The Robert Woodruff Foundation, and The University of Florida College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. All experiments and Weld work comply with the current laws of the USA.},
