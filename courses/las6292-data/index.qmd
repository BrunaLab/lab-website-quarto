_Graduate, 3 credits, Spring Semester (even years) _

## Course Objectives  

This course is for graduate students from any discipline – social sciences, humanities, biophysical sciences – and at all stages of their graduate program. It is an introduction to methods for collecting, organizing, managing, and visualizing both qualitative and quantitative data. Students will gain hands-on experience with best practices and tools; **_at the conclusion of this course students will be able to:_**

- Describe the different types of research data;
- Explain the need for and benefits of data management and sharing;
- Describe and implement best practices for the collection, storage, management, archiving, and sharing of research 1. data;
- Find, download, and analyze publicly available data from repositories;
- Carry out simple and reproducible data corrections and dataset organization;
- Describe public policies and agency requirements for data management and sharing;
- Articulate the major legal and ethical considerations regarding the collection, use, and storage of research data 1. (e.g., privacy/human subjects, intellectual property);
- Create and Implement and a Data Management Plan;  
- Identify and properly use tools and techniques for more efficient and secure data collection in the field.  

<!--- ## Course format

I believe there is no better way to learn than by doing, which is why this course is taught (mostly) using active learning approaches. Students are expected to complete each week’s assigned reading or watch brief video lectures prior class. The in-class session will typically include an opportunity for students to ask questions about the pre-class materials and for the instructor to briefly summarize material or demonstrate challenging concepts. Occasionally there will be a class discussion about the assigned reading. However, most of each class session will be spent working individually or in small groups on exercises that reinforce that week’s concepts and techniques. Throughout the session I will be circulating between groups to assist with the assignment, work though mistakes, and discuss how the techniques can be applied to each student’s research.

All students will clean and organize real data sets — ideally their own — and prepare a data collection and management plan for their research projects. --->
