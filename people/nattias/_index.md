Nina Attias is a Brazilian conservation biologist with over 15 years of experience in ecological studies. She has a PhD in Ecology and Conservation from Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul and a Master's degree in Ecology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Her research is in the broad area of spatial ecology applied to conservation, where she integrates behavioral ecology, spatial ecology and conservation biology to inform conservation decision making and outreach programs in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil. As an instructor and a field biologist, her postdoctoral research focuses on indentifying methods, tools, infrastructure and resources needed to teach field based courses remotely.
